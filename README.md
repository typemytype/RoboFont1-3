# oneToThreeRoboFontExtension

A RoboFont extension to assist during the transition from RoboFont 1.8 to RoboFont 3, helping developers to make their code compatible with both versions.

## Background

RoboFont 3 introduces two significant changes which affect the scripting API:

| RoboFont 1  | RoboFont 3    |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| RoboFab API | FontParts API |
| Python 2    | Python 3      |

This extension maps ‘forward’ from RoboFab to FontParts syntax (to make RF1 code compatible with RF3), and ‘backwards’ from FontParts to RoboFab syntax (to make RF3 code compatible with RF1). See [RoboFab vs. FontParts APIs](http://robofont.com/documentation/building-tools/toolkit/robofab-fontparts/).

**This extension does not handle Python 2 to Python 3 conversion.** See [Python 2 vs. Python 3](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#essential-syntax-differences).

## How to use oneToThree

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Double-click the `.roboFontExt` file to install the extension in both RoboFont 1 *and* RoboFont 3.

### In RoboFont 1

The extension makes API changes from RF3 available in RF1:

- unique identifiers
- `font.guidelines` and `glyph.guidelines` (in addition to `font.guides` and `glyph.guides`)
- representation factories
- new `mojo.UI` callbacks

The extension will also change the application name in the main menu from *RoboFont*, to *RoboFont 1.8*, so it’s easier to differentiate between the two versions of the app.

### In RoboFont 3

The extension routes deprecated RoboFab modules to their corresponding APIs in RF3:

- font objects
- pens
- dialogs
- misc tools
